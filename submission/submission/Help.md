Good day player!

This is my Hangman game!

The object of the game is to guess a word using the letters below, before our friend is hung.

There are eleven (11) chances for the player, so there is no rush!

The words are all names of programming languages.

HINT: What the creator did in testing, was to use all vowels first (a, e, i, o, u) and then based on that result would narrow down the answer. 

I hope you have fun playing this.

GOOD LUCK AND GOODBYE!!
